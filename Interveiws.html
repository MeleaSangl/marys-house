			<h1>Interveiws</h1>
			<h3>Because some of the information shared may be sensity I have chosen to keep identities of my interviewees between myself and those whom I interviewed. I will include relevant details about each participant. </h3>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>Interviewee One:</h3>
			<p>Male, 40+, has online stores: Paypal is not the best way to have people donate as it leads to a high shopping cart abandonment rate and reduces the amount they want to give because it takes them to a different website and people find that suspicious. There is no apostrophe in Maryâ€™s House at the top of the page. Have something to call people to subscribe to their cause with their email. So that they can contact those who are interested directly. </p>

            <h3>Interviewee Two:</h3>
			<p>Female, 40+, has children: The images that you first see are terrifying. There is way too much to read under the volunteer website. Nothing about the website made her believe that this was a good organization to donate to.</p>

			<h3>Interviewee Three:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+: The pro police flag does not make sense. Leave your political view at the door (referencing the police flag). Does the purple represent abuse? Really can not read the cursive font. Could not tell that economic abuse was a part of the rest of the abuse type categories. They need to have recovery stories for me to feel comfortable donating my time of money.</p>

			<h3>Interviewee Four:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+, was severely abused: Said that the website looked like a horror website with the pictures and font type. Also thought that there needed to be an about us page. She brought up the point that she would rather be alone, because people may not believe you or make things worse. Sme have Stockholm syndrome and want their abuser to not be involved. Add other resources that can help people learn more about how to help themselves if they do not feel comfortable going somewhere else. Liked that they said they only wanted good and healthy food donated not just canned goods.</p>

			<h3>Interviewee Five:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+, is of a minority: The police support flag is very off putting to racial minorities especially with recent events. The pictures are way too graphic. The picture for physical abuse could definitely throw people off. Way too many words on some pages.</p>

			<h3>Interviewee Six:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+: Make sure that on the contact us screen make sure people know that it is secure and private. Add a breakdown of what the money donated will go towards. The police flag is way too much.</p>

			<h3>Interviewee Seven:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+: Really liked the purple. Not sure what the website is actually for without me telling her. </p>

			<h3>Interviewee Eight:</h3>
			<p>Female, 20+, is severely abused: Really seemed to enjoy aspects of the website especially the purple because it is not normally a color you see on a webpage. Points out that if they send an email to an abuse victim that it should be in the spam folder and on the webpage tell them to look in their spam for a specific title that would seem normal to an abuser.</p>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>Results:</h3>
			<p> These interveiws has helped me in so may ways. I found that people actually enjoyed the purple just in smaller amonts than what was shown. They also gave me many great ideas to implement so that people feel more safe and secure on this website. It also reassured me that I am on the right path as many things we agreed on.</p>
